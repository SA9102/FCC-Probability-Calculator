# Probability-Calculator
This program creates an object that contains different coloured balls and the amount of balls of each colour. It also calculates the probability of picking at least the required number of coloured balls from the selection, when a specified number of random balls is selected (without replacing each selected ball). The program can perform the same experiment multiple times to calculate a more accurate probability.
